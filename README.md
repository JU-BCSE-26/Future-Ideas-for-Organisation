# Future-Ideas-for-Organisation
A list of ideas about what can be contributed to the organization in form of repos to help the students.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Voice Recording of the classes for easier revision at home
<li>Preparing handouts before the lectures so that students can have the pre-requisite knowledge before the class
<li>Suggest Reading material and assignments after the class
<li>Suggest homework assignments
<li>For the labs we can ourselves have assignments on <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">gradescope</a> and discussion on <a href="https://piazza.com/">piazza</a> which would keep us on track with out lab activity
<li>Keep proper track of classes and class summary
<li>Keep updated with class schedule and have a mock attendece app so as to encourage more attendence from students
<li>Develop Class projects (maybe for fun ðŸ˜Š)
</ol>
